## **Overview of the Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to convince W. Avery, a famous investor and passionate surfer, and his board of diretors to invest in our idea to open a surf & ice cream shop in Oahu. We will be using past weather data to show that the location, in regards to temperature and precipation, will be sustainable year-round. In order to demonstrate this, we will use two months half a year apart (June & December).

## Results

- The difference in mean temperatures between the these two months is ~3.0°F 
  - June's mean is 74.94°F
  - Dec's  mean is 71.04°F
- There is a wider range of temperatures in December than there are in June
  - June | High - 85°F, Low - 64°F | 21°F Difference
  - Dec  | High - 83°F, Low - 56°F | 27°F Difference

- Over a twelve month period we gathered that there were more reports of temperature being above 65°F
  - This was gathered from the station with the highest number of temperature observations.

- Over a twelve month period we can see that the precipitation score is mostly around 1-2, with spikes here and there to indicate wetter-than-usual conditions. Seeing an even distribution of these spikes we can argue that these are part of the normal tropical weather pattern.

## Summary 

W. Avery's main concerns were precipitation and consistent weather. In our analysis we see that precipitation, while is expected to occur in a tropical area, will have little effect on our business. We can also conclude that the temperature has proven to be moderate in this area as well; hovering around low to mid seventies year-round.
